### §8.2 Interface Management procedures

### §8.2.1 Reset

### §8.2.1.1 General

The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the F1AP UE-related contexts, in the event of a failure in the gNB-CU or gNB-DU. This procedure does not affect the application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the F1 Setup procedure.

The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

### §8.2.1.2 Successful Operation

### §8.2.1.2.1 Reset Procedure Initiated from the gNB-CU

In the event of a failure at the gNB-CU, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the gNB-DU.

At reception of the RESET message the gNB-DU shall release all allocated resources on F1 and radio resources related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the indicated UE contexts including F1AP ID.

After the gNB-DU has released all assigned F1 resources and the UE F1AP IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated logical F1-connections over the F1 interface, the gNB-DU shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The gNB-DU does not need to wait for the release of radio resources to be completed before returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical F1-connection list IE, then:

-	The gNB-DU shall use the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE and/or the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.

-	The gNB-DU shall include in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each UE association to be reset, the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the UE-associated logical F1-connection list IE. The UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical F1-connections. Empty UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

-	If the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE is included in the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-DU shall include the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

-	If the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE is included in the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-DU shall include the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

Interactions with other procedures:

If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except for another Reset procedure) on the same F1 interface related to a UE association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be aborted.

### §8.2.1.2.2 Reset Procedure Initiated from the gNB-DU

In the event of a failure at the gNB-DU, which has resulted in the loss of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the gNB-CU.

At reception of the RESET message the gNB-CU shall release all allocated resources on F1 related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the F1AP ID for the indicated UE associations.

After the gNB-CU has released all assigned F1 resources and the UE F1AP IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated logical F1-connections over the F1 interface, the gNB-CU shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical F1-connection list IE, then:

-	The gNB-CU shall use the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE and/or the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.

-	The gNB-CU shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each UE association to be reset, the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the UE-associated logical F1-connection list IE. The UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical F1-connections. Empty UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

-	If the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE is included in the UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-CU shall include the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

-	If the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE is included in a UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE for a UE association, the gNB-CU shall include the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE in the corresponding UE-associated logical F1-connection Item IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

Interactions with other procedures:

If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except for another Reset procedure) on the same F1 interface related to a UE association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be aborted.

### §8.2.1.3 Abnormal Conditions

Not applicable.

### §8.2.2 Error Indication

### §8.2.2.1 General

The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node in order to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.

If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

### §8.2.2.2 Successful Operation

When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving node.

The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE. In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by utilising UE associated signalling the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE and gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If one or both of the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID IE and the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to appropriate value, e.g., "Unknown or already allocated gNB-CU UE F1AP ID", "Unknown or already allocated gNB-DU UE F1AP ID" or "Unknown or inconsistent pair of UE F1AP ID".

### §8.2.2.3 Abnormal Conditions

Not applicable.

### §8.2.3 F1 Setup

### §8.2.3.1 General

The purpose of the F1 Setup procedure is to exchange application level data needed for the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU to correctly interoperate on the F1 interface. This procedure shall be the first F1AP procedure triggered for the F1-C interface instance after a TNL association has become operational.

NOTE:	If F1-C signalling transport is shared among multiple F1-C interface instances, one F1 Setup procedure is issued per F1-C interface instance to be setup, i.e. several F1 Setup procedures may be issued via the same TNL association after that TNL association has become operational.

NOTE:	Exchange of application level configuration data also applies between the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU in case the DU does not broadcast system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN, as specified in the TS 37.340 [7]. How to use this information when this option is used is not explicitly specified.

The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received. This procedure also re-initialises the F1AP UE-related contexts (if any) and erases all related signalling connections in the two nodes like a Reset procedure would do.

### §8.2.3.2 Successful Operation

The gNB-DU initiates the procedure by sending a F1 SETUP REQUEST message including the appropriate data to the gNB-CU. The gNB-CU responds with a F1 SETUP RESPONSE message including the appropriate data.

The exchanged data shall be stored in respective node and used as long as there is an operational TNL association. When this procedure is finished, the F1 interface is operational and other F1 messages may be exchanged.

If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the gNB-DU Name IE, the gNB-CU may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-DU. If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the Extended gNB-DU Name IE, the gNB-CU may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-DU and shall ignore the gNB-DU Name IE if included.

If the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the gNB-CU Name IE, the gNB-DU may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-CU. If the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the Extended gNB-CU Name IE, the gNB-DU may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-CU and shall ignore the gNB-CU Name IE if included.

If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the gNB-DU Served Cells List IE, the gNB-CU shall take into account as specified in TS 38.401 [4].

For NG-RAN, the gNB-DU shall include the gNB-DU System Information IE and the TAI Slice Support List IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message.

The gNB-CU may include the Cells to be Activated List IE in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message. The Cells to be Activated List IE includes a list of cells that the gNB-CU requests the gNB-DU to activate. The gNB-DU shall activate the cells included in the Cells to be Activated List IE and reconfigure the physical cell identity for cells for which the NR PCI IE is included.

If Cells to be Activated List Item IE is included in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message, and the information for the cell indicated by the NR CGI IE includes the IAB Info IAB-donor-CU IE, the gNB-DU shall, if supported, apply the IAB STC Info IE therein to the indicated cell.

For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU shall include the gNB-CU System Information IE in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message.

For NG-RAN, the gNB-DU may include the RAN Area Code IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message. The gNB-CU may use it according to TS 38.300 [6].

For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU may include Available PLMN List IE, and optionally also Extended Available PLMN List IE in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message, if the available PLMN(s) are different from what gNB-DU has provided in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, gNB-DU shall take this into account and only broadcast the PLMN(s) included in the received Available PLMN list(s).

For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU may include Available SNPN ID List IE in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message. If the available SNPN(s) are different from what gNB-DU has provided in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, gNB-DU shall take this into account and only broadcast the SNPN(s) included in the received Available SNPN ID list.

The Latest RRC Version Enhanced IE shall be included in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message and in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message.

If in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the Cell Direction IE is present, the gNB-CU should use it to understand whether the cell is for UL or DL only. If in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the Cell Direction IE is omitted in the Served Cell Information IE it shall be interpreted as that the Cell Direction is Bi-directional.

If the Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration IE is present in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the receiving gNB-CU shall use the received information for Cross Link Interference management and/or NR-DC power coordination. The gNB-CU may merge the Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration information received from two or more gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU shall consider the received Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration content valid until reception of an update of the IE for the same cell(s).

If the Aggressor gNB Set ID IE is included in the Served Cell Information IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, take it into account.

If the Victim gNB Set ID IE is included in the Served Cell Information IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, take it into account.

If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the Transport Layer Address Info IE, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, take into account for IPSec tunnel establishment.

If the SFN Offset IE is contained in the Served Cell Information IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, use this information to deduce the SFN0 offset of the reported cell.

If the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the Transport Layer Address Info IE, the gNB-DU shall, if supported, take into account for IPSec tunnel establishment.

If the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the Uplink BH Non-UP Traffic Mapping IE, the gNB-DU shall, if supported, consider the information therein for mapping of non-UP uplink traffic.

If the BAP Address IE is included in the F1 SETUP REQUEST, the receiving gNB-CU shall, if supported, consider the information therein for discovering the collocation of an IAB-DU and an IAB-MT.

If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message is received from an IAB-donor-DU, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, include the BAP Address IE in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message.

NOTE:	How to identify the IAB-donor-DU is up to gNB-CU implementation.

If the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the BAP Address IE, the gNB-DU shall, if supported, store the received BAP address and use it as specified in TS 38.340 [30].

If the NR Cell PRACH Configuration IE is included in the Served Cell Information IE contained in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU may store the information, and forward it to other RAN nodes for RACH optimisation.

If the RedCap Broadcast Information IE is included in the Served Cell Information IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU may use this information to determine a suitable target in case of subsequent outgoing mobility involving RedCap UEs.

If the TAI NSAG Support List IE is included in the Served Cell Information IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, use this information as specified in TS 23.501 [21].

### §8.2.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation

If the gNB-CU cannot accept the setup, it should respond with a F1 SETUP FAILURE and appropriate cause value.

If the F1 SETUP FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE, the gNB-DU shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the F1 setup towards the same gNB-CU.

### §8.2.3.4 Abnormal Conditions

Not applicable.

### §8.2.4 gNB-DU Configuration Update

### §8.2.4.1 General

The purpose of the gNB-DU Configuration Update procedure is to update application level configuration data needed for the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU to interoperate correctly on the F1 interface. This procedure does not affect existing UE-related contexts, if any. The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

NOTE:	Update of application level configuration data also applies between the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU in case the DU does not broadcast system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN, as specified in the TS 37.340 [7]. How to use this information when this option is used is not explicitly specified.

### §8.2.4.2 Successful Operation

The gNB-DU initiates the procedure by sending a GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the gNB-CU including an appropriate set of updated configuration data that it has just taken into operational use. The gNB-CU responds with GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to acknowledge that it successfully updated the configuration data. If an information element is not included in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall interpret that the corresponding configuration data is not changed and shall continue to operate the F1-C interface with the existing related configuration data.

The updated configuration data shall be stored in both nodes and used as long as there is an operational TNL association or until any further update is performed.

If gNB-DU ID IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message for a newly established SCTP association, the gNB-CU will associate this association with the related gNB-DU.

If Served Cells To Add Item IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall add cell information according to the information in the Served Cell Information IE. For NG-RAN, the gNB-DU shall include the gNB-DU System Information IE.

If Served Cells To Modify Item IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall modify information of cell indicated by Old NR CGI IE according to the information in the Served Cell Information IE and overwrite the served cell information for the affected served cell. Further, if the gNB-DU System Information IE is present the gNB-CU shall store and replace any previous information received.

If Served Cells To Delete Item IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall delete information of cell indicated by Old NR CGI IE.

If Cells Status Item IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall update the information about the cells, as described in TS 38.401 [4]. If if the Switching Off Ongoing IE is present in the Cells Status Item IE, contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, and the corresponding Service State IE is set to "Out-of-Service", the gNB-CU shall ignore the Switching Off Ongoing IE.

If Cells to be Activated List Item IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message, the gNB-DU shall activate the cell indicated by NR CGI IE and reconfigure the physical cell identity for cells for which the NR PCI IE is included.

If Cells to be Activated List Item IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message and the indicated cells are already activated, the gNB-DU shall update the cell information received in Cells to be Activated List Item IE.

If Cells to be Activated List Item IE is included in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message, and the information for the cell indicated by the NR CGI IE includes the IAB Info IAB-donor-CU IE, the gNB-DU shall, if supported, apply the IAB STC Info IE therein to the indicated cell.

If Cells to be Deactivated List Item IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message, the gNB-DU shall deactivate all the cells with NR CGI listed in the IE.

If Dedicated SI Delivery Needed UE List IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU should take it into account when informing the UE of the updated system information via the dedicated RRC message.

For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU shall include the gNB-CU System Information IE in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message. The SIB type to Be Updated List IE shall contain the full list of SIBs to be broadcast.

For NG-RAN, the gNB-DU may include the RAN Area Code IE in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message. The gNB-CU shall store and replace any previously provided RAN Area Code IE by the received RAN Area Code IE.

For NG-RAN, the gNB-DU may include the Supported MBS FSA ID List IE in the Served Cell Information IE in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message. The gNB-CU shall store and replace any previously provided MBS FSA ID list IE by the received MBS FSA ID list IE.

If Available PLMN List IE, and optionally also Extended Available PLMN List IE, is contained in GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message, the gNB-DU shall overwrite the whole available PLMN list and update the corresponding system information.

If Available SNPN ID List IE is contained in GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message, the gNB-DU shall overwrite the whole available SNPN ID list and update the corresponding system information.

If in GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the Cell Direction IE is present, the gNB-CU should use it to understand whether the cell is for UL or DL only. If in GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the Cell Direction IE is omitted in the Served Cell Information IE it shall be interpreted as that the Cell Direction is Bi-directional.

If the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes gNB-DU TNL Association To Remove List IE, and the Endpoint IP address IE and the Port Number IE for both TNL endpoints of the TNL association(s) are included in the gNB-DU TNL Association To Remove List IE, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, consider that the TNL association(s) indicated by both received TNL endpoints will be removed by the gNB-DU. If the Endpoint IP address IE, or the Endpoint IP address IE and the Port Number IE for one or both of the TNL endpoints is included in the gNB-DU TNL Association To Remove List IE in GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, consider that the TNL association(s) indicated by the received endpoint IP address(es) will be removed by the gNB-DU.

If the Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration IE is present in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the receiving gNB-CU shall use the received information for Cross Link Interference management and/or NR-DC power coordination. The gNB-CU may merge the Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration information received from two or more gNB-DUs.

### §8.15.3.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the gNB-DU cannot identify the previously requested measurement to be terminated, it shall ignore the PDC MEASUREMENT TERMINATION COMMAND message.

### §8.15.4 PDC Measurement Failure Indication

### §8.15.4.1 General

The purpose of the PDC Measurement Failure Indication procedure is for the gNB-DU to notify the gNB-CU that the PDC measurements previously requested with the PDC Measurement Initiation procedure can no longer be reported. The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

### §8.15.4.2 Successful Operation

The gNB-DU initiates the procedure by sending a PDC MEASUREMENT FAILURE INDICATION message. Upon reception of the PDC MEASUREMENT FAILURE INDICATION message, the gNB-CU shall consider that the indicated PDC measurements have been terminated by the gNB-DU.

### §8.15.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

### §8.15.4.4 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### §8.16 QMC Procedures

### §8.16.1 QoE Information Transfer

### §8.16.1.1 General

The purpose of the QoE Information Transfer procedure is to transfer RAN visible QoE information from the gNB-CU to the gNB-DU. The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

### §8.16.1.2 Successful operation

The gNB-CU initiates the procedure by sending the QOE INFORMATION TRANSFER message to the gNB-DU.

If the QoE Information List IE is included in QOE INFORMATION TRANSFER message, the gNB-DU may take it into account according to TS 38.300 [6].

### §8.16.1.3 Abnormal Conditions

Not applicable.


### §9 Elements for F1AP Communication

### §9.1 General

Subclauses 9.2 and 9.3 present the F1AP message and IE definitions in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.4. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional IEs, where the tabular format shall take precedence.

The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified in TR 25.921 [14].

When specifying IEs which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);

-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);

-	When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

The following attributes are used for the tabular description of the messages and information elements: Presence, Range Criticality and Assigned Criticality. Their definition and use can be found in TS 38.413 [3].

### §9.2 Message Functional Definition and Content

### §9.2.1 Interface Management messages

### §9.2.1.1 RESET

This message is sent by both the gNB-CU and the gNB-DU and is used to request that the F1 interface, or parts of the F1 interface, to be reset.

      The Transaction ID IE uniquely identifies a procedure among all ongoing parallel procedures of the same type initiated by the same protocol peer. Messages belonging to the same procedure use the same Transaction ID. The Transaction ID is determined by the initiating peer of a procedure.
      
      NOTE:	If F1-C signalling transport is shared among multiple interface instances, the Transaction ID is allocated so that it can be associated with an F1-C interface instance. The Transaction ID may identify more than one interface instance.
